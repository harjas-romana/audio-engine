# Audio Engine 🎧

hey wassup, this is **Audio Engine** - a chrome extension i made for youtube so u can listen to music the way it SHOULD sound

---

## what is this thing??

ok so basically i was tired of youtube audio sounding mid on my earbuds. so i made this extension that lets u mess with the audio in realtime. like u can add surround sound, boost the bass, make vocals clearer, all that good stuff

its got like a bunch of modes n settings n u can save ur own presets too which is pretty cool ngl

---

## features n stuff

- **16D surround sound** - makes it sound like the music is all around u (not the rotating kind, just fixed surround)
- **360 degree audio** - full sphere immersion thing, sounds crazy with good earbuds
- **studio mode** - for when u want that clean flat sound, no coloring
- **concert hall** - makes it feel like ur in a big room lol
- **vocal clarity** - pushes the vocals forward if u wanna hear lyrics better

theres also:
- 10 band equalizer (the sliders thing)
- bass n treble buttons for quick adjustments
- reverb controls
- stereo width (make it wider or mono)
- compressor n bunch of other pro stuff
- save ur own presets!!
- factory presets if ur lazy like me lmao
